      "17852_2_4": "Secondly this removes the ability of the majority of a population to engage in what the French economist Bastiat called ` legalized plunder ' , where they -LRB- as the majority of voters -RRB- assign higher percentages of income tax to the wealthy in order that the state may appropriate and redistribute it to them for their own use .", 
      "17852_2_5": "With a flat tax in place , there would be no ability for anyone to vote for a tax rise simply on other people and not on themselves , and thus such policies would receive more consideration and not be used by the majority simply to appropriate the property of others through the law .", 
      "17852_2_2": "However , this parity can be achieved by everyone paying the same percentage of their income in tax to the government , and this is exactly what a flat tax is , and so equality in contribution to government services -LRB- mirroring equality in access to government services -RRB- is achieved .", 
      "17852_2_3": "This principle of equality is important for two reasons : firstly , if wealthier citizens feel they are being unfairly burdened by the current requirement that they pay higher percentages of their income to fund government services than those on lower incomes , they may feel a disincentive to work hard -LRB- which creates wealth for the whole economy -RRB- , or may even be driven abroad to states with lower rates of taxation or to tax havens .",
